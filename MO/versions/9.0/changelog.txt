§l§bAdded§r:
- Nvidium (beta version only)
> Nvidium is a replacement rendering backend for sodium that uses nvidia only opengl extensions to increase fps by a significant amount. (Disables itself when iris is actively using shaders)
> > If I feel like its stable enough I'll add it into the release version.
> This mod uses uncommon technology (mesh shaders). This may result in minecraft terminating unexpectedly. Report any bugs [here](https://github.com/MCRcortex/nvidium/issues)
(Nether Fog dose not work atm, might have issues with portals after some time)
